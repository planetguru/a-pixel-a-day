=============

Render text one byte every five weeks on the most restrictive screen available. 

With a total of 366 pixels, the github commit timeline under the developer profile section offers a 52x7 resolution screen which can only be updated at a rate of 1 pixel per day.

This project aims to automate that process, allowing the developer to specify a string of ~10 bytes to be rendered over the following 50 weeks on their github page.

Excruciating, pointless, but a fun exercise in computer science.
